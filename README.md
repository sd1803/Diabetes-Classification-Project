Classifying Diabetes Cases in a Health Dataset | R and Python

Classified diabetes cases using machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression, LDA, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost and SVM) on a dataset with 21 features. Performed under-sampling to handle imbalanced data and achieved 81 % Test Accuracy and 83 % precision and 79% Precision in Random Forest. Extracted insights from health-related data and identified key features related to diabetes. The joint work was done on R. But since we couldn't use SMOTE in R ( was taking a lot time), I personally implemented it in Python and also done the whole work in Python. The main difference of the Python and R code is how the imbalanced data had been handled. Both the methods are giving similar results. I would suggest to look the R code as it is more compact and detailed. Also the report is based on R code.
